Abstract 
This paper focuses on retrofitting techniques to strengthen distressed structural members and replace damaged 
strip seal expansion joints in a bridge rehabilitation project in Andhra Pradesh, India. The study examines the 
effectiveness of shotcreting, grouting, repair mortar, and high-strength micro concrete jacketing in repairing 
various types of damage. 
Proper maintenance is crucial to ensure the longevity and performance of bridge structures, as they are highly 
susceptible to deterioration due to environmental factors and traffic loads.

1. INTRODUCTION  
Rehabilitation and retrofitting are essential processes in structural strengthening. Retrofitting focuses on seismic 
strengthening, while rehabilitation focuses on repairing and strengthening existing concrete structures under 
gravity loads. Strip seal joints are commonly used in reinforced concrete T-beam cum deck slabs to 
accommodate moderate movements in medium-span bridges. However, continuous exposure to heavy traffic 
loads can cause distress in these joints due to factors such as concrete quality, environmental conditions, and 
inadequate maintenance. This paper discusses the latest retrofitting and repair techniques used in a case study to 
strengthen structural members and expansion joints of bridges in the Eluru-Anakapalli section of Andhra 
Pradesh. 
2. LITERATURE REVIEW

4. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 
The research methodology involved a systematic approach to repairing and retrofitting the damaged bridge 
structures. The process included identifying the location of voids, drilling and fixing PVC nozzles, injecting 
low-viscous epoxy material, grouting with cement slurry and expanding grout admixture, replacing damaged 
expansion joints, shotcreting, and applying an anti-carbonation coating. 
Fig.2: Flow Chart of Repair/Retrofitting Works 
Specification-1: Shotcreting 
Shotcreting of piers/abutments and the underside of the deck slab will be done to a thickness of 40-50mm after 
fixing shear connectors and a 50mm x 50mm geo grid.  Surface preparation involves chipping off all loose, 
spalling concrete and delaminated shotcrete until sound concrete/shotcrete is exposed. The chipped area will be 
saturated with water before repair, and all exposed reinforcement will be coated with Zinc Rich Epoxy Primer 
IPNET RB (from M/s Krishna Conchem). For fixing shear connectors, 14mm diameter holes will be drilled to a 
50mm depth at 500mm centers.  These holes will be thoroughly cleaned with an air/water jet.  8mm rebar shear 
connectors will be fixed using polyester resin grout SYSGROUT 657 (from M/s Syscon Resins). A 50mm x 
50mm geo grid will be tied to the exposed reinforcement/shear connectors, ensuring minimal sagging, 
especially on the underside of the slab. Before shotcreting, the prepared concrete surface will be wetted. 
Shotcreting will then be carried out using a mix proportion of 1 part cement, 2 parts sand, 2 parts 6-8mm down 
aggregate, and 125 gms of polypropylene fibers per bag of cement.  The average thickness will be maintained 
between 40-50mm. The shotcrete area will be cured for at least 7 days. 
Specification-2: Epoxy Injection Grouting 
Treatment of soffit slab cracks will be done using epoxy injection grouting.  First, cracks in the superstructure 
will be identified, marked, and grooves of 15mm x 15mm will be cut and chipped off using a suitable tool like a 
marble cutting machine or handheld grinder. The cut groove will be cleaned with an air/water jet and filled with 
epoxy putty such as SIKADUR 31 (from M/s Sika India Limited) or equivalent. For vertical/overhead 
applications, silica powder may be added to the Sikadur 31 for desired consistency. Next, 12/14mm diameter 
holes will be drilled along the crack at 300mm centers, 50-60mm deep, and cleaned. PVC nozzles or packers 
will be fixed in these holes using epoxy putty/polyester resin grout.  After the epoxy grouting, the nozzles will 
be cut off level. Holes can be drilled and nozzles fixed simultaneously with groove filling for easier application. 
Once all nozzles are fixed, epoxy injection grouting will be done using an electrically operated epoxy grout 
pump with low viscosity epoxy injection grout like EPCOKP250 (from M/s Krishna Conchem) or SIKADUR 
52 (from M/s Sika India Limited). For vertical cracks, grouting should start from the bottom hole and proceed 
upwards. 
Specification-3: Cement Grouting 
Cement grouting will be applied to the underside of the deck slab/piers/abutments. 14/16mm diameter holes will 
be drilled at 1000mm centers, especially on the underside of the slab, with additional holes at visible

honeycombed areas of slabs/piers/abutments. The holes will be 50-75mm deep and cleaned with an air/water 
jet. 8mm/12mm PVC nozzles will be fixed using quick-setting cement grout. Neat cement grouting will be done 
through the nozzles using a positive displacement, electrically operated grout pump. An expanding grout 
admixture, such as CEBEX 100 (from M/s Fosroc chemicals) or INTRAPLAST N200 (from M/s Sika India 
Ltd), will be mixed into the grout per the manufacturer’s specifications. If shotcreting is also being done, 
grouting will occur only after the shotcreting is complete. Protruding nozzles will be cut off 24 hours after 
grouting and finished. For piers/abutments, grouting should start at the bottom and proceed upwards, while for 
girders, it should start at one end and progress to the other. 
Specification-4: Expansion Joints 
Treatment of expansion joints will occur after traffic is diverted to the new bridge, as joint treatment must be 
synchronized with bearing replacement.  It is recommended that the wearing course (proposed Bitumen 
Wearing Course) be completed before replacing the expansion joints.  First, a saw cut will be made parallel to 
the joint, approximately 300mm away from it, down to the main deck slab concrete. The wearing course will be 
chipped and opened up to 300mm on either side of the joint, and the existing joint will be removed.  Once 
removed, the joint will be cleaned of debris and dust.  16mm diameter holes will be drilled in 2/3 rows on either 
side of the joint at 300mm centers, 50-75mm deep. 12mm diameter rebar will be fixed in these holes using 
polyester resin grout as shear connectors. Reinforcement will be fixed and tied to the shear connectors as per 
specifications. 
Fig.3: Fixing Arrangement of Strip Seal Expansion Unit 
Fixing of New Strip Seal Joint: The new strip seal joint will be leveled and welded to the reinforcement, 
maintaining the level with the existing wearing course. Concreting will be done using M35 grade concrete after 
applying an epoxy bonding agent to the old concrete surface. The concrete will be cured for at least 7 days. 
5. EXECUTION DETAILS 
The execution of the repair process involved several steps. Loose and spalled concrete was chipped off, and 
localized spalled regions were repaired using polymer-modified repair mortar. Major delaminated regions were 
treated with shotcreting after fixing a geo grid. Old damaged strip seal expansion joints were removed, and new 
joints were fixed with additional reinforcement and micro concrete.

First, workers are depicted applying shotcrete to the underside of a bridge deck. This involves spraying a 
concrete mix at high velocity to repair areas where the original concrete has deteriorated or spalled off. In 
another section of the bridge, workers are injecting a grout material into cracks and voids in the concrete. This 
process, known as grouting, fills gaps in the structure and strengthens it.  A worker is then shown smoothing the 
surface after the grout has been injected, ensuring a level and even finish. Finally, the image illustrates the 
replacement of an expansion joint. This involves removing the old, damaged joint and preparing the area for a 
new one.  Reinforcement bars are added to the joint area to provide additional support and strength. The new 
expansion joint is then installed, allowing the bridge to expand and contract with temperature changes without 
causing damage to the structure. 
4. CONCLUSION 
All the damaged portions of the bridge structural members were repaired and strengthened. Localized spalled 
regions were treated with repair mortar, while honeycombed areas received epoxy/cement injection grouting. 
Major delaminated or spalled regions were addressed using shotcreting. Damaged strip seal expansion joints 
were replaced with new ones, including additional reinforcement and high-grade micro concrete.  The repair and 
retrofitting process ultimately increased the durability of the bridge structures.
